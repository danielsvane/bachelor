abstract = {The specificity and predictability of Watson-Crick base pairing make DNA a powerful and versatile material for engineering at the nanoscale. This has enabled the construction of a diverse and rapidly growing set of DNA nanostructures and nanodevices through the programmed hybridization of complementary strands. Although it had initially focused on the self-assembly of static structures, DNA nanotechnology is now also becoming increasingly attractive for engineering systems with interesting dynamic properties. Various devices, including circuits, catalytic amplifiers, autonomous molecular motors and reconfigurable nanostructures, have recently been rationally designed to use DNA strand-displacement reactions, in which two strands with partial or full complementarity hybridize, displacing in the process one or more pre-hybridized strands. This mechanism allows for the kinetic control of reaction pathways. Here, we review DNA strand-displacement-based devices, and look at how this relatively simple mechanism can lead to a surprising diversity of dynamic behaviour.},

@article{Seelig2006,
abstract = {Biological organisms perform complex information processing and control tasks using sophisticated biochemical circuits, yet the engineering of such circuits remains ineffective compared with that of electronic circuits. To systematically create complex yet reliable circuits, electrical engineers use digital logic, wherein gates and subcircuits are composed modularly and signal restoration prevents signal degradation. We report the design and experimental implementation of DNA-based digital logic circuits. We demonstrate AND, OR, and NOT gates, signal restoration, amplification, feedback, and cascading. Gate design and circuit construction is modular. The gates use singlestranded nucleic acids as inputs and outputs, and the mechanism relies exclusively on sequence recognition and strand displacement. Biological nucleic acids such as microRNAs can serve as inputs, suggesting applications in biotechnology and bioengineering.},

@article{Engelen2016,
abstract = {DNA has emerged as a highly versatile construction material for nanometer-sized structures and sophisticated molecular machines and circuits. The successful application of nucleic acid based systems greatly relies on their ability to autonomously sense and act on their environment. In this feature article, the development of DNA-based strategies to dynamically control protein activity via oligonucleotide triggers is discussed. Depending on the desired application, protein activity can be controlled by directly conjugating them to an oligonucleotide handle, or expressing them as a fusion protein with DNA binding motifs. To control proteins without modifying them chemically or genetically, multivalent ligands and aptamers that reversibly inhibit their function provide valuable tools to regulate proteins in a noncovalent manner. The goal of this feature article is to give an overview of strategies developed to control protein activity via oligonucleotide-based triggers, as well as hurdles yet to be taken to obtain fully autonomous systems that interrogate, process and act on their environments by means of DNA-based protein control.},

abstract = {The impressive capabilities of the mammalian brain—ranging from perception, pattern recognition and memory formation to decision making and motor activity control—have inspired their re-creation in a wide range of artificial intelligence systems for applications such as face recognition, anomaly detection, medical diagnosis and robotic vehicle control 1 . Yet before neuron-based brains evolved, complex biomolecular circuits provided individual cells with the 'intelligent' behaviour required for survival 2 . However, the study of how molecules can 'think' has not produced an equal variety of com-putational models and applications of artificial chemical systems. Although biomolecular systems have been hypothesized to carry out neural-network-like computations in vivo 3,2,4 and the synthesis of artificial chemical analogues has been proposed theoretically 5–9 , experimental work 10–13 has so far fallen short of fully implementing even a single neuron. Here, building on the richness of DNA com-puting 14 and strand displacement circuitry 15 , we show how molecular systems can exhibit autonomous brain-like behaviours. Using a simple DNA gate architecture 16 that allows experimental scale-up of multilayer digital circuits 17 , we systematically transform arbitrary linear threshold circuits 18 (an artificial neural network model) into DNA strand displacement cascades that function as small neural networks. Our approach even allows us to implement a Hopfield associative memory 19 with four fully connected artificial neurons that, after training in silico, remembers four single-stranded DNA patterns and recalls the most similar one when presented with an incomplete pattern. Our results suggest that DNA strand displace-ment cascades could be used to endow autonomous chemical systems with the capability of recognizing patterns of molecular events, mak-ing decisions and responding to the environment. The human brain is composed of ,10 11 neurons, and each has a few thousand synapses. Each synapse can receive signals from other neu-rons, raising or lowering the electrical potential inside the neuron. When the potential reaches its threshold, the neuron will fire and a pulse will be sent through the axon to other neurons. Among the simplest mathematical models of neurons is the perceptron, also known as the linear threshold gate 1,18,20},

@article{Picuri2009,
abstract = {Defined broadly, molecular translators are constructs that can convert any designated molecular input into a unique output molecule. In particular, the development of universal nucleic acid translators would be of significant practical value in view of the expanding biomedical importance of gene diagnostics. Currently, diagnostic assays for nucleic acids must be individually developed and optimized for each new sequence because inputs for one assay are sequence-specific and are therefore incompatible with any other assay designed for the detection of a different nucleic acid. However, if a desired nucleic acid sequence could be translated in vitro into a predetermined nucleic acid output for which there is already a known diagnostic assay, then that single assay could be easily adapted to detect nearly any strand. Here we investigate PCR-independent isothermal molecular translation strategies that function without the need for post-translation purification and can be implemented with commercially available components. Translation yields up to 96{\%} are obtained in 5 min at room temperature with minimal background reaction ({\textless} 1{\%}) and with discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the input sequence. Furthermore, we apply these translators to adapt a high-gain HIV diagnostic system for high-throughput detection of hepatitis C, avian influenza (H5N1), and smallpox without making changes to the underlying assay. Finally, we show the feasibility of translating small-molecule interactions into nucleic acid outputs by demonstrating the utility of a DNA aptamer for translating adenosine into a readily detectable output DNA sequence. Additionally, equilibrium expressions are described in order to facilitate rational engineering of aptameric translators for label-free detection of any molecule that an aptamer can recognize.},
