\section{Introduction}
Logic circuits using RNA has many interesting applications in diagnostics and treatment. An example is cancer detection, where miRNA's can be used as biomarkers \cite{Peng2016}. These biomarkers can be used as inputs for logic circuits, which can be designed to activate FRET signals or enzymatic pathways when combinations of biomarkers are detected.

DNA logic circuits have been studied extensively \cite{Zhang2011}.
