\section{Introduction}
Logic circuits using DNA and RNA has many interesting applications in diagnostics and treatment. An example is cancer detection, where miRNA's can be used as biomarkers \cite{Peng2016}. These biomarkers can be used as inputs for logic circuits, which can be designed to activate FRET signals \cite{Seelig2006} or enzymes \cite{Engelen2016} when combinations of biomarkers are present or absent. For example, a circuit could be designed to activate when 2 unique miRNA's are present at the same time, or when a certain protein is present. This is represented schematically in figure \ref{example_circuit}.

  (or1.out) node [anchor=west] {FRET or enzymatic activity}

The logic gates can be made using strand displacement \cite{Zhang2011}, where the outputs of one gate can be linked to the input of another by unique DNA or RNA sequences.
