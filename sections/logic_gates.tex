\section{Logic gates}
Logic gates in electric circuits are usually made using transistors. They can take boolean inputs (0 or 1) and output another boolean signal depending on the inputs and type of logic gate. An example of an AND logic gate can be seen in figure \ref{and_gate}.

\end{figure}

Different gates exist, with different truth tables. These gates can be combined into more complex circuits, like calculators and integrated circuits, which exist in all modern computers.
